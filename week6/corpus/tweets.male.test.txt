1995	human	M	@ babyitsmb @ jacobnwolf has that been confirmed ? 
1995	human	M	@ jacobnwolf but i get your intended point . almost a sub - brand of the brand . 
1995	human	M	@ jacobnwolf your previous tweet suggested the former . not trying to be picky , but a lot gets picked up from one line from someone in the know :) 
1995	human	M	@ jacobnwolf my point is rather that we don ‚Äô t know if they ‚Äô ll buy an existing infrastructure and out into new corporation or build from ground up . 
1995	human	M	@ jacobnwolf rather , it could be like mlb and their lower league club perhap ? 
1995	human	M	@ jacobnwolf copy of tweet is a little misleading . dignita has no relation in naming to 76 ers , same as heat & misfit . more the relationship . 
1995	human	M	@ jacobnwolf you might want to clarify this . make it sound like they ‚Äô ll be buying out an existing org ... i . e immortal etc ...

1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ mikestubbsy @ themartinwyatt @ meekel @ warrenfish _ awesome . let ‚Äô s get some matche setup online . will ping you my gt ! 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ mikestubbsy @ themartinwyatt @ meekel @ warrenfish _ ps 4 or xbox ? i ‚Äô ll have to adjust . 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ mikestubbsy i ‚Äô ll 1 v 1 you for point . 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ epsilon _ grumpy they know they have limit for how competitive they can be , they just have to work within those constraint . 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ epsilon _ grumpy another side effect : the less professional team and the filler ones may fall by wayside . same with any league - see west ham for instance . 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ epsilon _ grumpy let ‚Äô s not forget that all those team ( dig , immortal etc ) also have huge vc fund powering them . they ‚Äô re hardly restricted . 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ epsilon _ grumpy if all the team were backed by big brand that would be fair , but currently it ‚Äô s a split . 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal it ‚Äô s just they have to make sure they do it authentically . that old buzzword :) 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal that ‚Äô s fair to an extent , but in the other side these brand can bring a lot of desperately needed infrastructure and expertise . 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal side effect with any high growth product unfortunately . until a brand step up and flip the meta like fnatic it ‚Äô s challenging . 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal the warrior for instance , will be one of the best front office in the industry . the cavs , don ‚Äô t get me started ... 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal personally think riot are striking a nice balance between established endemic and non endemic . 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal what i find laughable is people getting all entitled about team not being accepted when they often barely have an infrastructure for it . 
1995	human	M	@ epsilon _ grumpy @ rahul __ uppal you ‚Äô d be surprised by who we ‚Äô ve turned away . money isn ‚Äô t everything . as riot are proving . 
1995	human	M	@ rahul __ uppal @ epsilon _ grumpy would love to know reasoning why ?

1995	human	M	that ‚Äô s not to say it can ‚Äô t be done . owl would do well to look at eleague csgo vts for inspiration . 
1995	human	M	rl excel in its simplicity . lol has a fanbase . ow ? i ‚Äô m not yet convinced . amazing fun to play , so difficult to explain to a new viewer . 
1995	human	M	99.9% of viewership is online . that is why it ‚Äô s so crucial to deliver a simple viewing product . 
1995	human	M	outside of tent pole event , there ‚Äô s no evidence you could fill a significantly sized arena each week . 
1995	human	M	league and owl may be in the same city , but no number so far suggest they ‚Äô d be competing for viewership . different demo and fan makeup . 
1995	human	M	given owl is highly unlikely to be pulling thousand of lan spectator ( capacity is well below that ), i don ‚Äô t buy the la piece with imt . 
1995	human	M	@ alicusofficial definitely not best on a corporate level . up there but tl , envy and fnatic have levelled up considerably . imt still not staffed properly .

2007	human	M	amlo campaigned in 8 us city even though this is technically against mexican election law . this was a big change in campaign strategy from 2006 when he refused to go to the us at all . he was helped by electoral reform that eased registration abroad . 
2007	human	M	but diaspora mexican were never a reliable base for the pan given their socioeconomic diversity . having failed to halt corruption and violence after two term in office , the party had squandered much of its legacy as the party of democratic change among mexican abroad . 
2007	human	M	for 2 decade , the default opposition party for mexican abroad ( mostly us ) was the pan , beginning with fox , who had widespread diaspora support . in 2012, v√°zquez mota won the largest vote share in the diaspora despite getting the smallest vote share overall . 
2007	human	M	the pri , being in power for 7 decade , produced 7 decade of emigrant who blamed the party for the condition under which they left . other mexican party compete for diaspora support by being the most viable alternative to the pri .
