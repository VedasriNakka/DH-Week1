2279	human	F	@ jesslint literally brilliant . 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten interesting commentary about your third party testing : urllink why not make your study easier for consumer to understand ? as presented , they ’ re convoluted for most people . 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten in my own test , while blasting the molekule on high for 48 hour straight ( while out of the house , on vacation ) it literally showed no difference to my test run under the exact same condition with molekule turned off . 30% variance or not , that ’ s pretty compelling evidence .

2279	human	F	@ mamaofabean not gonna jump right in to the girl scout cooky or pink kush just yet ;) 
2279	human	F	@ mamaofabean i am definitely an newbie at this . so . i bought a few different thing to sample . all pre - rolled of course , since i have zero talent in this area . i bought some 1:1 sativa , some 1:1 indica , some ace valley cbd (6% thc ) & some bc sensi star (15% thc ). taking it low & slow . 
2279	human	F	now , what kind of online shopper extraordinaire would i be if i didn ’ t buy 🌿 @ ontariocannabi today ? my curiosity has already got the better of me . urllink # buyweedonlineunlocked # october 17 urllink 
2279	human	F	@ kejsarmakten @ molekuleair the air was “ heavy and itchy ” which is maybe a better word to describe my experience . irritating . dry eyes & throat . i ’ m asthmatic , so sensitive to it all . both hepa filter and opening window helped . unfortunately , molekule did not . both from personal symptom & aq testing . 
2279	human	F	@ kejsarmakten @ molekuleair also , the air quality sensor we used showed increased level of particulate ( in ppb ), so there was definitely something in the air beside a lack of oxygen . the hepa filter cleaned it up no problem & left a fresher smell behind . for $1200, i would expect even better performance 
2279	human	F	@ kejsarmakten @ molekuleair i didn ’ t know carbondioxide smell like musty basement . opening up window in the winter when it ’ s -20 degrees out is ideally what i am hoping to avoid . obviously we live in different climate ! 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten if the air was “ completely purified ” shouldn ’ t it smell completely purified ? i expected swiss mountaintop fresh air . instead i got musty basement stuffy air with your purifier running full blast all night long . that just doesn ’ t pass the sniff test for me ( pardon the pun ). 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten any reason why you won ’ t consider independent testing through more well - known and reputable source like @ consumerreport ? for a $1200 air purifier , it should be made as easy as possible for your customer to be crystal clear on the transparent value of your product . 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten if your unit can ’ t also mechanically filter larger particle ( which seem strange that it somehow pick up small particle but not larger ones ) then what are consumer aqi sensor picking up that molekule can ’ t get seem to get rid of the way a hepa filter can ? 
2279	human	F	@ kejsarmakten @ molekuleair it does for us during the spring , in which case a purifier is helpful , but not the rest of the year . our test happened in the past month . 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten if your purifier can not , at least , impact what a hepa filter can , then essentially it does not appear to be moving enough air . from my own experience , the molekule left our air unfresh . only an opened window helped until we got a different purifier . 
2279	human	F	@ molekuleair @ kejsarmakten that ’ s interesting . opening a window seemed to be the easiest way to improve air quality . this was certainly consistent with our test . i still don ’ t understand why your unit does not appear to clean what a hepa filter can . shouldn ’ t it do both ?
